# A brief (2h) introduction to programming in Python for absolute beginners, 2020 Edition

v1.0 (2019): The course was initially developed and delivered by Timo Flesch and Mirta Stantic.    
v2.0 (2020): The course was refined and delivered by Timo Flesch and Jelka Stojanov.

A brief intro to Python, a powerful general-purpose programming language, designed for second-year undergraduate students in Experimental Psychology and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Oxford.

In this course, you will learn:

-	how to assign values to variables and perform different mathematical operations;
-	how to manipulate data formats and data sets;
-	how to use loops, functions and methods (you will not only use existing functions in Python, but also create your own).

We will also introduce you to some of the most important libraries in the scientistâ€™s toolkit.

Finally, you will apply the knowledge you have gained to run a few simple statistical analyses (repeated-measures ANOVA, linear regression) on a real dataset and to visualize the results.

This course does **NOT** assume any previous knowledge of Python or any other programming language.
Resources for those who are interested in learning more will be provided in the interactive worksheet in class.
