A brief intro to Python, designed for 2nd year undergraduate students in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford.  
**Blurb (draft):**   
"This course will introduce you to Python programming and will assume no previous knowledge of other programming languages. Weâ€™ll skip the basics of setting up the programming environment to teach you how to assign values to variables,manipulate data formats and data sets and how to write your own loops, conditionals and functions. You'll then apply the knowledge you've gained to run a few simple statistical analyses on a real dataset and visualise the results.
No prerequisites expected. Resources for those who are interested in learning more will be provided in the interactive worksheet in class."
