#### **Learn to code!**
1. A complete course https://www.learnpython.org
2. Ditto https://www.w3schools.com/python/ 
3. Advanced course https://automatetheboringstuff.com

#### **How to install Python**
1. Just Python
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python
2. The Jupyter Notebook (the thing you've been working with today)
https://jupyter.org/install
3. Anaconda (a collection of useful packages and other software for data scientists)
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

#### **Text editors**
Note: If you don't use notebooks, you'll need a text editor to write your Python code. **Don't use Microsoft Word!** You want something that automatically highlights code (and makes it easier to distinguish variables, functions and the like), and provides autocompletion (saves A LOT of time). 

Below are a few free and popular choices:
1. atom editor https://atom.io/
2. vscode https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Sublime https://www.sublimetext.com/

All these editors support multiple programming languages. I write my Python, Matlab, Javascript code and documentation in Markdown or Latex in Atom. Saves so much time!

#### **All-in-one solutions**
You can also use an all-in-one solution that provides you with an editor, code interpreter (the thing that allows the computer to read and execute Python code) and file managers(a bit like the Matlab software or R-Studio, which you might have heard of). 

For Python, you can use:

1. Spyder (free) https://www.spyder-ide.org/
2. Pycharm (free basic and commercial pro version) https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

#### **Coding challenges**
These challenges are a great way to test your understanding of computer
science concepts and improve your logical thinking / problem solving skills.

**Pro tip**: Almost every company uses these challenges to assess candidates for software engineering and data science positions.
1. Hackerrank https://www.hackerrank.com/ 
2. Leetcode https://leetcode.com 

#### **Python for psychologists**
You can use Python add-ons to run your own experiments, analyse behavioural, eye-tracking and neuroimaging data
and to make beautiful visualisations of your results.
